# A-brush

Simulation at: https://youtu.be/wuuxO71caIQ

The A-Brush features a design similar to a 3D printer, leveraging a sophisticated
system of sliders, distance sensors, and rotating brushes. The device is placed on
top of the aquarium and securely attaches to the walls by its extendable side bars.
Its intelligent distance sensors detect the edges of the tank, automatically calculating
the maximum allowable movement for optimal performance.
A central horizontal and one sided slider move along the top of the aquarium,
enabling the device to move from one side to the other in 2 axes directions. Attached
to this is a vertical slider, which controls a bar that extends down into the tank. The
vertical slider moves up and down to reach different heights along the aquarium
walls.
A unique cleaning mechanism are the two rotational cylinders. The first cylinder,
attached to the vertical slider, rotates 90 degrees each time, allowing the device to
reach all four walls of the aquarium without manual repositioning. The second
cylinder, connected to the first one, does the actual cleaning part with a cover brush.
This brush rotates as it scrubs the surfaces, efficiently removing algae, grime, and
debris from the glass.
The entire system works in perfect synchronization, ensuring that every corner of the
aquarium is thoroughly cleaned. The rotating brush can adjust its position based on
the orientation of the first cylinder, meaning the A-Brush can seamlessly transition
from one wall to the next.
